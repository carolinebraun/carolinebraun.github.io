	  <h2>Interests</h2>
	  <p class="moveover">I love to travel. I'll sit through a week-long conference if it means I get to see a new city. Adventure is awesome. In summer 2017, I loved backpacking Europe as well as working on a microfinance project with a local textile and ecotourism business in Cusco, Peru.
  	  <p class="moveover">I love my friends. They're the best people I know. Who else would visit Niagara Falls in December? Celebrate New Year's in a parking lot? Get me to run a mini marathon?
	  <p class="moveover">I love filmmaking. I'm never going to be the creative genius, but I love helping with the logistics that make someone's vision come to life. Production is dynamic and all-consuming like nothing else.</p>
	  <p class="moveover">I love rabbits. As a child, my family had every kind of small animal, from hedgehogs to chinchillas. I petsit whenever I get the opportunity. Even if it's an injured bat we found in a parking lot.</p>
	  <p class="moveover">I love cooking. Especially pasta. If it has lemon, pesto or garlic, it's going to be good, and cooking is an amazing stress reliever.</p>

	  <h2>Feedback</h2>
	  <p class="i3right">From Erin Hollinden, Hoosier Hills Food Bank</p>
	    <p><i>A good number of agencies this month took advantage of our new option for submitting service statistics using the online form Caroline created for us.  I asked how it worked for them and got comments like this:
		</br></br>From an elderly food pantry operator who previous printed the form, wrote on it, copied it, and snail-mailed it to me:  “It was very easy.  Thanks.”
		</br></br>From a minister who single-handedly runs both a youth program and a food pantry:  “It was so easy to input my stats!  I really appreciate this online option.”
		</br></br>From a residential recovery program supervisor who has often sent stats late but was prompt this time: “I indeed found the new form to be way easier to fill out and submit. Thank you.”
		</br></br>From manager of free public lunches who has been in her position only six months: “I really liked submitting the stats online. I feel like it was much easier.”
		</br></br>From a food pantry director who previously printed the form, wrote on it, took a picture of it, and texted it to me: “It was super easy!!” 
		</br></br>So thank you, Caroline and Jake!</i></p>
		<p class="i3right">From Dr. Mark Saunders, Website Client & Inventor of AxisEnAqua</p>
		<p><i>From what I have seen with your website development and your extracurricular involvement related to your academic career, you have a very promising and rewarding journey ahead. I look forward to seeing great accomplishments coming from you and all of your noble efforts.</i></p>
